# CLA Blocks
A WordPress plugin that adds a collection of blocks to the Block Editor that are as unopinionated as possible in their style, providing only functionality, so that WordPress themes can easily override them without having to undo predefined styling. All blocks are built with the same hierarchical structure, having a top level container element (.block-class-name-container) with a child element (.block-class-name) so that all blocks can take advantage of @container queries. All blocks are also built to be compliant with the WCAG 2.1 AA specification for web accessibility.
